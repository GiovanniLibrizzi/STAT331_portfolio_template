My data science skills have improved a ton by taking this course. I was really unfamiliar with how graphs and plotting worked for different types of data, but taking this class helped me understand what types of plots belong with different forms of data. DVS-3 Example 2 shows off my use of density ridges, which I don't think I even knew existed before this class. This artifact really demonstrates the part of data scientist I've learned the most from, as other topics I've picked up over time from various other programming courses. Plots like the ones we create with ggplot2 are more exclusive to data science, and since my statistics experience was lacking coming into this course, learning about all the different types of plots we could make and being able to utilize them was really useful.
